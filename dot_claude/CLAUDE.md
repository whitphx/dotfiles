## Git commit policy

When I make code changes that form a coherent, meaningful batch ready for version control, I may commit them autonomously based on my judgment.

**Restrictions:**
- Never amend commits unless explicitly instructed by the user for that specific commit
- Never push commits unless explicitly instructed by the user for that specific commit

Note: Permission to amend or push applies only to the particular commit the user mentions in their instruction. This permission does not carry over to subsequent commits—each commit requires its own explicit instruction.
